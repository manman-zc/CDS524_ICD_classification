# 6. Discussion

Our study provides empirical support for the application of multi-task learning in medical text analysis, verifying the effectiveness of partial parameter sharing architecture in balancing task commonality and specificity. An automatic coding system with an accuracy of 71.25% can significantly reduce the workload of medical coders, accelerate the clinical document processing workflow, and improve the operational efficiency of medical institutions. We adopted an intuitive interface design to help medical professionals understand and use the system more easily. This real-time capability is particularly important in clinical environments, as it can improve work efficiency. The system presents the prediction results in a structured manner, making it easier for medical professionals to quickly understand and adopt, further enhancing the practical value of the system.

However, the dataset used in this study is relatively small (800 training samples), which may limit the model's generalization ability, especially for the identification of rare disease codes. Although the accuracy of 71.25% is significantly better than the baseline method, manual review may still be required in clinical practice, limiting the fully automated application of the system. Deep learning models such as BERT are often regarded as "black boxes" and lack interpretability, which may cause trust and adoption issues in medical decision support. Due to the use of the full BERT model, the system may encounter performance bottlenecks in resource-constrained environments. Future work can consider model quantization or distillation to improve inference speed. The system only provides prediction results without explaining the basis for specific predictions. Adding model interpretability features can increase doctors' trust in the system. Currently, it only supports prediction for a single record and lacks batch processing capabilities. Future work can add batch upload and processing functions. There is no built-in model update mechanism, and model files need to be manually replaced. Future work can implement an online model update function to continuously improve the system.
