In recent years, research on automating ICD diagnostic coding has gradually emerged. Traditional methods primarily rely on feature engineering and statistical models, often struggling to capture the complex semantics embedded in large-scale electronic medical records. With the advent of deep learning techniques and the emergence of large language models (LLMs), the field has seen a significant paradigm shift.

Recent work by Yoo and Kim [3] introduced an innovative approach leveraging LLMs for ICD coding, achieving enhanced performance over traditional methods. Their study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to understand and contextualize medical texts.

Furthermore, Kane et al. [4] provided a compressed large language model embedding dataset for ICD-10-CM descriptions, which facilitates the development of more efficient and accurate coding systems. Their contribution underscores the advantages of integrating LLM embeddings to bridge the gap between complex medical narratives and computational analysis.

Moreover, comparative studies between traditional machine learning methods and pre-trained model-based techniques have confirmed the significant advantages of the latter in handling the complexity of medical texts. These investigations provide essential theoretical and empirical support for the automated coding and diagnostic decision-making in medical contexts.
