# 7. Conclusion

This study addresses the issue of automated ICD diagnostic coding for Chinese electronic medical records by comparing the performance of traditional machine learning methods (SVM) and deep learning methods (pre-trained BERT). The results show that the deep learning method based on pre-trained BERT significantly outperforms the traditional SVM method in this task, achieving a classification accuracy of 71.25%, which is comparable to the accuracy of large language models used in current competition leaderboards. This study provides an effective solution for the automated ICD diagnostic coding of Chinese electronic medical records, contributing to the improvement of the efficiency and quality of medical data management. Future research will further enhance the performance and practicality of the model, promoting the in-depth application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field.
